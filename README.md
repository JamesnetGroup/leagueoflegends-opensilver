## Project Introduction

This OpenSilver version of the League of Legends client demonstrates how to leverage XAML-based development patterns in modern web applications. By utilizing OpenSilver's capabilities, we've created a web-based implementation that maintains the rich user experience of the original client while offering the advantages of web deployment.

The project showcases how to implement large-scale web applications using OpenSilver, demonstrating best practices for web-specific optimizations while maintaining the familiar XAML development patterns. It provides valuable insights into building complex web applications that can run in any modern browser.
